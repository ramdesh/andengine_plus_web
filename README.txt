===AndEngine + Web===

 ‘AndEngine + Web’ is conceived as a web interface provided to develop AndEngine games in a simple drag-and-drop manner, removing the need to install bulky SDKs, learn complex programming concepts, or familiarization with the AndEngine framework. It aims to provide the power of AndEngine without the trouble of learning a large amount of extra concepts, and allows developers to focus on creating games rather than on how to create them.
